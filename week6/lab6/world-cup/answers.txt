Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The less simulations, the least accurate the results, because the sample size is not enough to provide an accurate result.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I would settle for predictions after 10000 simulations.
