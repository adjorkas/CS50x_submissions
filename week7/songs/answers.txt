1) I believe this listener's "Audio Aura" could either be Orange or Purple, since the music choices lean towards fast-paced and energetic. Average energy: 0.65906, danceability: 0.71646, valence: 0.484443.

2) Perhaps the average doesn't include the "mood swings" or the extremes a person might feel. I would write a python script to analyze the ranges of the values in energy, valence and danceability, instead of only keeping the averages.
